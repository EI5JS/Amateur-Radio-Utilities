The following is details of how the Amateur Radio apps should be run:




EI5JS Spaceweather:

The space weather app requires Python 3 to be installed on the PC. When run, it reads the current 
noaa.txt document from the NOAA website and presents it in a small window showing the Ap, Kp, 
solar flux index, the time the document was uploaded by NOAA (usually no older than 3 hours) and 
whether Solar Storm alerts exist. Clicking the Solar Storm line opens Spaceweather.com in your browser.
Because the Window is so small, geometry should not be an issue. Changes can be easily made to the code
as it is well commented. Bear in mind this was my first attempt at coding which runs flawlessly on my 
PC and should run flawlessly on yours. 





EI5JS Logbook v1:

This is v1 of what will eventually be a very nice, elegent and efficient logbook. Currently the code
is in two files. The first is the contact input screen (EI5JS Logbook v1) which has save, clear and logbook buttons.
Save creates a database (.db) file if none already exists and saves the contact information in there. 
The second file (Logbook) opens the database and presents the contacts in a viewer screen. A button
under the log entries called "Edit contacts in DB Viewer" does just that. It opens the database in 'DB Viewer
for SQLite' for editing and management as needed. Therefore, DB Browser for SQLite needs to be installed.  

Version 2 of this app will include logbook editing but for now it is limited to logging and log viewing.
DB Browser for SQLite is used for logbook editing for now.

Requirements:  Python 3 and DB Browser for SQLite from https://sqlitebrowser.org
