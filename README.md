# Amateur-Radio-Utilities
A collection of Amateur Radio utilities. Please read the ReadMefirst file for app details.

I am new to coding. I am coding in Python 3 at the moment.I currently have two Ham Radio related
applications here. One is a completed "Spaceweather" app that tells you the current Spaceweather.
The second is a work in progress, though it works as is. It is currently in two parts, a contact 
logger and a contact database viewer. A third party database editer should be used to edit the db.

These two run flawlessly on my PC. If you run them on yours, they should run jsut as well. Your 
resolution will likely be different to mine so there may be some geometry issues but the code is
well commented and you should be able to tweak the GUI if needed. 

I am working on v2 of the Logbook which will combine the files into one and add database editing
and management functionality. 

I would be very grateful if you could send any tips and improvements back to me so I can improve 
these apps and my coding in general.
